## What went wrong in the project
<p>We got into trouble with Datadog and it works locally but couldnt figure out how to integrate it with aws on our last day</p>
<br>
<p>Overall this project over the course of 3 weeks was very challenging and a great learning experience and useful for the job market.</p>
