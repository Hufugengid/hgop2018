## What is Linux?
Linux is a open source operating system written in C and assembly. 
Its build around the Linux kernel and its first release was 
17. september 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Linux was originally developed 
for home/personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture.

## Why use Linux? What are the pros and cons?
Linux has a better command line rather than other mainstream operating systems.
Some say it is better for development and more extensible and customizeable
 than Windows. Also package managers help a lot. Cons are that we are used to
using the windows OS rather than Linux, the only thing we can think of.
