# Docker Exercise
The point was getting us familiar with Docker, an important tool for developers.

## What is Docker?
Docker is a container tool designed to run applications using these containers. The designer create, deploy and run the applications with these containers.
Docker works similarly to a virtual machine.

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image
Virtual machine is a clean machine with a whole operating system ready to build/run an app.
We can run a virtual machine on our personal computer but that would require a lot of time, by
installing the operating system from beginning and takes a lot of ram and hard disk space.
In a way Docker is similar to a virtul machine but is much faster performance wise and reduces
space needed, by using docker containers we are able to run the required installations/execution parameters which is defined
by the docker image. In short the container is an stateful instantation of an image.

## Web API?
API stands for application programming interface. Web API is for web development for a web server or a web browser.

## Postgres?
Database management system.

## package.json file dependencies field:
It lists what the jason file depends on in our case express and postgres.

## NPM express package:
Web API which enables us to connect to port 3000.

## NPM pg package:
PostgreSQL client for nodejs.

## What is docker-compose:
It is a tool for defining and running multi container Docker apps.

## Results
We installed Docker on our machines, followed the step by step guide on github for the day's exercise. We created
a Docker image and stored it on Docker Cloud, which abled us to run this app on any machine. Finally we connected
two containers together using the Docker compose. This was an exciting introduction to Docker.
