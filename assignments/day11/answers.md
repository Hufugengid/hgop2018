##Inside server.js:Explain why we put each consecutive call inside the onSuccess callback of the previous database call, instead of just placing them next to each other.
These functions are running asynchronously, meaning that they are running together, at the same time. In this particular case, if the post request is to be accepted, all of the three get functions have to succeed. To clarify, since the functions are set to the onSuccess callback of the previous database, the error from the innermost function for example will bounce all the way to the top, and send an error to the post request. Of course it works both ways, if the post request works out fine, each of the outer functions have made sure that the inner functions work as intended. It's like having a if statement at top of each function, without having to write the if statement.

##Inside server.api-test.js: What does the done parameter do?
Bascially, Done is a callback, that gets called once we are done with our work. In this case, it's used as a parameter in the helper file, or more accurately the server.lib-test.js file. The test will then run until either done or done.fail(err) gets called, or it times out. The result of the test then relies on this outcome.
